'Private-events' is a project designed to practice ActiveRecord associations.  It is a barebones site with minimal styling added, as the intention was to practice working on the backend, specifically with multiple models and a through table among other 'Railsy' conventions.

Description:
A site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events which can be attended by other users.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
